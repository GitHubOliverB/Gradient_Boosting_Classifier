<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][Tree-screenshot]]

There are many Gradient-Boosting-Classifier templates available on GitHub, however, 
I didn't find one that needs heavy editing or was automated enough for an easy use.
Also most seem to lack important figures and plots, helping you to optimize your setup and deal with overfitting.
I want to create a template so amazing that it'll be the last one you ever need. 

Of course, no template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue.

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.

### Built With
This project was build using Python 3.7.4 and the following Python libraries installed:

* [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
* [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
* [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
* [seaborn] (https://seaborn.pydata.org/)
* [SciPy] (https://www.scipy.org/)
* [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This is an example on how to use this template for your own classification problems.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Installation

1. Install Python and all libraries needed
2. Clone the repo
```sh
git clone https:://github.com/your_username_/Project-Name.git
```
